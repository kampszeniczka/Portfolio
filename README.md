## About me

My name is Kamila and I'm from Poland. I started my IT adventure at the end of 2020. Interested in the visual side of applications and websites, I began to deepen my knowledge of FrontEnd development. I started my lerning by reading about HTML and CSS languages. Then I started practicing it by writting code. I can create a basic website using this two coding languages. I'm a creative person and I'm always looking for solutions on how to combine aesthetic impression with usability. I know the graphic programs and the UX/UI design principles. A few months ago I became interested in software testing. I found out about this profession relatively recently and I liked it very much. I'm self-taught and acquire most of my knowledge on my own. I took part in a course in manual testing to improve and develop my practical skills. I'm a good observer and can easily find problems. I have no problem with writing reports and submissions.

I always set high expectations for myself and constantly strive to set higher and higher goals. Here is my [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/kamila-pszeniczka/). Thanks!
